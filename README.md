# Leaf-classification-system
An automated system for classifying leaves using a ensemble of deep learning and machine learning models.
Plant identification is one of the most important steps of plant conservation. furthermore, this identification of leaf can be used to classify, and provide a detailed feature of that species. with increasing global warming and melting arctic ice, conservation of plants has become one of the most active studies of research. As the age of artificial intelligence is expanding, many studies have been proposed to tackle this problem with deep learning and machine learning.
Image augmentation and enhancement techniques have made work faster and simpler toward the final model development. The model demonstrated in the following paper uses 21 classes of leaf, which bring an ensemble of AlexNet and XGBoost classifier. The model provides a consistent accuracy of 95%  and 98% of average precision over each class of leaf.
